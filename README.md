For this assignment, you will use the sakila database. If you installed MySQL on your computer, sakila is included. If you are using vlab, there are installation instructions in a separate file.

The sakila database includes information about a video rental store in the days before live streaming.

The figure shows the tables and relations. On the left side you can see tables of data about the movies and actors, and on the right there are tables about employees, customers and rentals.

Write SQL queries to do the following:
